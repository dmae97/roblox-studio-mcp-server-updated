## 💬 **Natural Language Usage Examples**

### 🎯 **Beginner-Friendly Conversation**
```
User: "I'm new to Roblox. How do I create a simple jumping game?"

AI: "Welcome to Roblox development! I'll help you create your first jumping game step by step.

🎮 **Game Creation Plan**
1. Basic character setup
2. Jump mechanics  
3. Platform creation
4. Simple UI

Let's start with the character controller. Would you like me to:
- Generate the movement script for you?
- Explain how jumping physics work?
- Create a complete template?

What would you prefer?"

User: "Generate the movement script please"

AI: "Perfect! I'm creating a beginner-friendly movement script for you.

✅ **Character Movement Script Generated**
- WASD movement controls
- Space bar jumping  
- Smooth camera follow
- Mobile touch support

The script includes detailed comments explaining each part. 
Would you like me to explain how any part works?"
```

### 🔧 **Advanced Developer Conversation**
```
User: "Optimize my multiplayer racing game for mobile performance"

AI: "Analyzing your racing game for mobile optimization...

📊 **Performance Analysis Results**
- Current FPS: 45 (Target: 60)
- Memory usage: 180MB (Target: <120MB)  
- Draw calls: 450 (Target: <200)

🎯 **Optimization Strategy**
1. **3D Models**: LOD system + mesh decimation (30% perf gain)
2. **Textures**: Mobile compression + mipmapping (25% memory save)
3. **Scripts**: Event batching + object pooling (20% CPU save)
4. **Physics**: Simplified collision detection (15% gain)

Implementing optimizations now...
✅ All optimizations applied successfully!

**Results**: 60 FPS achieved, 115MB memory usage
Test your game and let me know if you need further adjustments."
```

### 🌐 **Korean Language Example**
